The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide.

The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.

The app should show 4 charts on one screen, based on the input data we will provide within the next 24 hours. We will announce how you can submit your finished work later in this channel.
